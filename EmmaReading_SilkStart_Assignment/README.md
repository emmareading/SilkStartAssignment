# Emma Reading Silk Start Assignment

####INSTRUCTIONS

Open up my assignment by double clicking on the index.html file. Once opened, you will see my idea for a simple and responsive product page for the imagined e-commerce store.

####SUMMARY
1. I used GIMP to add the Ebay logo and colour the aeolian logo**
2. The colour picker does work; however, I also had an idea to let customers choose their own colour (I got this inspiration from the Nike website where customers can design their own shoes). I was unable to implement this option but I feel that I would have been able to if I had spent a bit more time working on it!


####ADDITIONAL INFO

__Inspiration__  
1. I got most of my inspiration for the look and feel of the site from bootstrap themes. I love their simplicity.  
2.  I chose the colour scheme based off of personal preference as well as my mother's favorite colour (she is a business women aged 30-60).  
3. I used font-awesome   
 

__**Note__  
I definitely felt that I struggled with image editing, as I'm sure you can tell via the aeolian logo and the colour picker images for the hairdryer. This is definitely something I am going to work on in the future.


####THANK YOU
Thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to do this assignment. I feel that I have learned a lot, including what I need to work on going forward.
